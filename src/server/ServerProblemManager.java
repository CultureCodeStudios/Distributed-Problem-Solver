//Theoretical only at this point Implmented somewhat inside the multithreaded problem manager.
//I'm thinking of adding a problem manager that just tries to maximize grid usage
//even if it breaks first come first server order.
//doing so would break the BlockingQueue current implementation
//I really like BlockingQueue because it's much safer to deal with with multiple threads.
